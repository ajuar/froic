## Origin

One day, I was reading [Hadoop: The Definitive Guide][1]. In the book, the
author quotes Hadoop's creator, Doug Cutting, saying that:

> [Hadoop is] the name my kid gave a stuffed yellow elephant.
> Short, relatively easy to spell and pronounce, meaningless, and not
> used elsewhere: those are my naming criteria. Kids are good at
> generating such. Googol is a kidâ€™s term.

I was struck by this idea and set out to create a program to do just that:
generating names that are **short**, relatively **easy to spell and
pronounce**, **meaningless** and **not used anywhere**.

The program generated its own name.
